What it does
 I built a **real-time weather dashboard** (HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JS) that consumes the **OpenWeatherMap API** to render 5-day forecasts with **city-search, GPS auto-locate and °C/°F toggle**.  
The app debounces API calls to **< 300 ms**, lazy-loads weather icons and switches background gradients dynamically based on conditions, achieving a **Google Lighthouse performance score of 94**.
